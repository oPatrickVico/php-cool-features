- USE COMPOSER!
  - `composer -v` for help
  - `composer init` for starting a project
  - Always do `require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php;` on top of main. That is the line that adds the dependencies installed
- Classes are modules
  - Private variables are local
  - Public variables are global
  - Setters and getters create permissions that safeguard bad behavior
  - Classes hold valuable information and functions that do one thing
- `public`, `protected` and `private` keywords
  - `static`, `self` and `this` keywords matters too
    - Great explanation: https://blog.lupecode.com/php-static-vs-self/
- Magic methods (**get, **set, **sleep, **wakeup) for classes and how to use them

    - READ THE COMMENTS
    - get, set and call magic methods are bad in most cases, except for handling things that don't existe with more grace. Instead of allowing dynamic assigment, you reject it with context.
  - serialize and unserialiaze to store objects
  - invoke to make an object callable (behave like a function) (https://www.php.net/manual/pt_BR/function.usort.php)
    - call and invoke magic methods are different: the former calls functions that don't exist, the latter makes the object behave like a function (essentially creating a closure, because you keep a set of state in the function)
- Arrays are Plain Old Objects. They are pretty good. If you want Fancy Clever Objects, use classes.
- Favor print_r() over var_dump()
- SeguranÃ§a em PHP:

- You can call methods and get properties dynamically with php.
  - use the notation `$obj->{'methodName'}()` for functions and `obj->{'propertyName'}`.
  - This is different from the get magic method. The one above doesn't get what isn't there
  - Remember, just like javascript, you can add new stuff to objects and arrays easily
